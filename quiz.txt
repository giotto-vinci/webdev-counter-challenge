1. Why do you use "using strict" at the top of your JS files?
"use strict", is a directive used in js files to help catch errors, improve security, and increases code quality.

2. What does line 3 mean?
Line 3 declares count as a variable equal to 0.

3. What is happening on lines 5-8 and why?
Lines 5-8 are declared constants, meaning the values of the variables cannot be reasigned.  So, the count, increment, reset, and decrement buttons are set.

4. If you implemented the functionality of the buttons,
   why do you think I wrote the JS code the way I did?
To make the code easily accessible to copy and paste throughout the file, maybe.
